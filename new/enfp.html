      	<p>As an ENFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via 
your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel 
about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system.</p><p>ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of 
possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the 
ability to inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk their way in or out 
of anything. They love life, seeing it as a special gift, and strive to make the most out of it.</p> 
<p>ENFPs have an unusually broad range of skills and talents. They are good at most things which interest 
them. Project-oriented, they may go through several different careers during their lifetime. To onlookers, 
the ENFP may seem directionless and without purpose, but ENFPs are actually quite consistent, in that they 
have a strong sense of values which they live with throughout their lives. Everything that they do must be 
in line with their values. An ENFP needs to feel that they are living their lives as their true Self, walking in 
step with what they believe is right. They see meaning in everything, and are on a continuous quest to adapt 
their lives and values to achieve inner peace. They're constantly aware and somewhat fearful of losing 
touch with themselves. Since emotional excitement is usually an important part of the ENFP's life, and 
because they are focused on keeping "centered", the ENFP is usually an intense individual, with highly 
evolved values.</p> 
<p>An ENFP needs to focus on following through with their projects. This can be a problem area for some of 
these individuals. Unlike other Extraverted types, ENFPs need time alone to center themselves, and make 
sure they are moving in a direction which is in sync with their values. ENFPs who remain centered will 
usually be quite successful at their endeavors. Others may fall into the habit of dropping a project when 
they become excited about a new possibility, and thus they never achieve the great accomplishments which 
they are capable of achieving.</p> 
<p>Most ENFPs have great people skills. They are genuinely warm and interested in people, and place great 
importance on their inter-personal relationships. ENFPs almost always have a strong need to be liked. 
Sometimes, especially at a younger age, an ENFP will tend to be "gushy" and insincere, and generally 
"overdo" in an effort to win acceptance. However, once an ENFP has learned to balance their need to be 
true to themselves with their need for acceptance, they excel at bringing out the best in others, and are 
typically well-liked. They have an exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short 
period of time, and use their intuition and flexibility to relate to others on their own level. 
Because ENFPs live in the world of exciting possibilities, the details of everyday life are seen as trivial 
drudgery. They place no importance on detailed, maintenance-type tasks, and will frequently remain 
oblivious to these types of concerns. When they do have to perform these tasks, they do not enjoy 
themselves. This is a challenging area of life for most ENFPs, and can be frustrating for ENFP's family 
members.</p> 
<p>An ENFP who has "gone wrong" may be quite manipulative - and very good it. The gift of gab which they 
are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get what they want. Most ENFPs will not abuse their 
abilities, because that would not jive with their value systems.</p> 
<p>ENFPs sometimes make serious errors in judgment. They have an amazing ability to intuitively perceive 
the truth about a person or situation, but when they apply judgment to their perception, they may jump to 
the wrong conclusions.ENFPs who have not learned to follow through may have a difficult time remaining happy in marital 
relationships. Always seeing the possibilities of what could be, they may become bored with what actually 
is. The strong sense of values will keep many ENFPs dedicated to their relationships. However, ENFPs like 
a little excitement in their lives, and are best matched with individuals who are comfortable with change 
and new experiences.</p> 
<p>Having an ENFP parent can be a fun-filled experience, but may be stressful at times for children with 
strong Sensing or Judging tendencies. Such children may see the ENFP parent as inconsistent and difficult 
to understand, as the children are pulled along in the whirlwind life of the ENFP. Sometimes the ENFP will 
want to be their child's best friend, and at other times they will play the parental authoritarian. But ENFPs 
are always consistent in their value systems, which they will impress on their children above all else, along 
with a basic joy of living.</p> 
<p>ENFPs are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined to strict schedules 
or mundane tasks. Consequently, ENFPs work best in situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and 
where they can work with people and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to 
be quite productive with little supervision, as long as they are excited about what they're doing. 
Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments, ENFPs often suffer from 
muscle tension. They have a strong need to be independent, and resist being controlled or labeled. They 
need to maintain control over themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their dislike of 
dependence and suppression extends to others as well as to themselves.</p> 
<p>ENFPs are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented individuals with capabilities 
ranging across a broad spectrum. They have many gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those 
near them, if they are able to remain centered and master the ability of following through. </p>

are not naturally good at following things through to completion. Accordingly, they should avoid jobswhich require performing a lot of detailed, routine-oriented tasks. They will do best in professions which 
allow them to creatively generate new ideas and deal closely with people. They will not be happy in 
positions which are confining and regimented.</p>

 		<p>ENFPs are motivated in everything that they do by a desire to understand the world around them. They are 
constantly searching about. Mentally and physically, for input that will help them to better understand the 
Big Picture. They are open-minded to new people and new experiences; they’re eager for the opportunity 
to understand what the new people and experiences are all about. ENFPs use their understanding of the 
world to serve the agendas of their value systems. An ENFP’s value system often includes respect for the 
needs and desires of individual people over the needs of a social group. Their respect for the individual 
makes them dislike controlling others, and being controlled by others. ENFPs are passionate about their 
beliefs, whatever they may be. They often stubbornly adhere to their value system regardless of threats to 
its validity. They are more concerned with keeping true to what they believe than they are with 
expectations or demands from the social group that they function within. ENFPs dislike personal criticism, 
because it threatens their validity as an individual and the validity of their value system. ENFPs may 
internalize anger rather than express it; their respect for other individuals makes it difficult for them to hurt 
others. An ENFP’s feeling of success depends upon the availability of opportunities to grow their 
understanding of the world, upon feeling that they’re living true to their personal value system, and upon 
the condition of their closest relationships.</p>

       <p>As an ENFP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural strengths for other 
types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more 
readily see your place in the world, and be more content with your role. </p>
<p>Nearly all ENFPs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should embrace and 
nourish these strengths: </p>
<ul>
<li>They’re exceptionally perceptive about people and situations. They’re often able to quickly and 
accurately assess where someone is coming from.</li> 
<li>They accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian. They believe that 
individuals have the right to be themselves, and are very tolerant and accepting of most people.</li>
<li>They’re often deep and intelligent, and may be quite brilliant in their ability to tie things together.</li> 
<li>They’re wired to look for connections in the external world, and so they may mentally put things 
together more easily than others. </li>
<li>Their interest in understanding the world usually makes them in tune with what’s socially 
acceptable and what isn’t. This may help them to be popular and likeable. </li>
They’re highly creative. This ability may be used in an artistic way, or may be used to generate 
ideas and new ways of thinking.</li> 
<li>ENFPs who have developed their Introverted Feeling to the extent that they apply judgment to all 
of their perceptions will enjoy these very special gifts:</li> 
<li>They will have the ability to follow through on projects they’ve begun.</li> 
<li>They will be less gullible and malleable, and generally more able to discern between “good” and 
“bad”, rather than accepting everything without question.</li> 
<li>They may be highly artistic. </li>
<li>They will have the ability to focus and concentrate deeply on tasks. This enhanced ability to think 
and process information internally will make them more capable on many levels. </li>
<li>They will balance out their desire to meet new people and have new experiences with the desire to 
put their understanding to use in some way. </li>
<li>They will find more meaning and purpose in their lives. </li>

       <p>With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be no "good". 
Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our 
weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our 
strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our 
personality type's potential problem areas.</p> 
<p>Most of the weaker characteristics found in ENFPs are due to their dominant Extraverted Intuition 
overshadowing the personality to the extent that they don’t apply judgment to anything. Or, they may use 
their primary judging function (Introverted Feeling) to support the agenda of Extraverted Intuition, i.e. to 
rationalize and support the idea of welcoming all experiences and accepting all individuals. In such cases, 
an ENFP may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degree: </p>
<ul>
<li>May be what many would call a “sucker”; vulnerable to schemers and con artists.</li> 
<li>May get themselves into dangerous situations because they’re too eager to push the envelope of 
their understanding, and not willing to apply judgment to anything. </li> 
<li>May feel intense anger towards people who criticize them or try to control them. But will be 
unable to express the anger. Left unexpressed, the anger may fester and simmer and become 
destructive. </li> 
<li>May blame their problems on other people, using logic and ration to defend themselves against the 
world. </li> 
<li>May develop strong negative judgments that are difficult to unseat against people who they 
perceive have been oppressive to them. </li> 
<li>May get involved with drugs, alcohol, or promiscuity, and generally seek mindless experiences 
and sensations. </li> 
<li>May skip from relationship to relationship without the ability to commit. </li> 
<li>May start projects but be unable to finish them. </li> 
<li>May be unable to stick to a career or job for any length of time.</li>

     	<p>Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the 
common ENFP problem of wanting to understand and experience everything at any cost. If the ENFP does 
not learn how to discriminate things and people in their external environment, the ENFP will begin to use 
their judging function (Introverted Feeling) as solve a “rubber stamper” to support their agenda to seek out 
experiences. This is a natural survivalist technique for the ENFP personality. The main driver to the ENFP 
personality is Extraverted Intuition, whose purpose is to understand the world as one Big Picture, seekingconnections and meaning in everything. If their ability to seek understanding is threatened, the ENFP shuts 
out the threatening force. This is totally natural, but unfortunately the individual who exercises this type of 
agenda protection regularly will become more and more unable to apply judgment to anything. When the 
unbalanced ENFP does apply judgment, it will generally be skewed to support their subjective agenda. 
They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behavior. They will be unable to finish 
anything that they start, and generally wander through life from experience to experience. </p>
<p>It’s very common for ENFPs to resist applying judgment until they feel they truly understand a person or 
situation. However, part of the understanding process includes using discernment to classify qualities. If 
the ENFP shuts judgment off entirely, he or she will not achieve their ultimate goal of understanding; rather 
they will jump from experience to experience in a purposeless fashion. </p>
<p>Anger can be a problem for anybody, but may be especially so for ENFPs who have not sufficiently 
developed their Introverted Feeling. The desire to keep everything non-judgmental, combined with the 
tendency to use Introverted Feeling as justification rather than true judgment is a recipe for suppressed 
anger. These are very contradictory forces. “I hate you for judging me” is an ironic feeling, but is 
unfortunately common. The inability to apply judgment or to accept negative judgment prevents the ENFP 
from expressing negative judgment, and therefore causes them to stew in their anger, rather than deal with 
it. </p>

        <p>To grow as an individual, the ENFP needs to focus on applying judgment to all of their perceptions. This 
means they need to decide how they really feel about people, places and things, rather than allowing their 
feelings to hang open indeterminately. The ENFP needs to understand that developing their ability to 
discern qualities does not threaten their ability to understand the world, but rather enhances it, and enhances 
their personal changes for achieving a measure of success in their lives. 
The ENFP concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for making a 
judgment. Are they trying to really determine the objective value or merit of something, or are they trying 
to defend their individual right to not be judged or controlled? The goal when judging something is to not 
let your personal agenda influence your opinions. Obviously, this is not entirely possible, but it is the 
exercise to keep in mind. You want to open your mind to judgment without feeling threatened, and without 
using your own judgment in a defensive, rationalizing mode.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the above, some ENFPs can have difficulty fitting into society. Their problems are 
often due top feeling different from others because of their dominant Intuition, and being unable to stick to 
anything long enough to feel a sense of accomplishment. They feel like they don’t fit in, and can’t find the 
place where they belong in the world. The ENFP who consistently makes decisions and applies 
classifications to their ideas will be able to turn their ideas into reality, and experience the feelings of 
accomplishment and success that accompany being effective.</p> 
<p>The key to personal growth for the ENFP is competent execution of Introverted Feeling. It’s difficult for 
most to understand what this means, much less incorporate that directive into your life. I have created 
some action-oriented suggestions that will help lead you down the path towards more effective use of the 
Introverted Feeling function. Specific suggestions:</p> 
<p>When you feel angry or resistant towards someone who you feel is criticizing you, take this as a cue that 
you are not judging effectively. When that happens, take a step back from your anger and try to really hear 
what the person is saying objectively. Rather than expending mental energy in defining how the other 
person is wrong, try to judge what the person is actually saying. 
Periodically make lists of goals and accomplishments. Revisit your goals and accomplishments as often as 
you’d like to maintain a sense of direction.</p> 
<p>Spend time alone regularly for the purpose of thinking through issues in your life.</p>

     	<ol> 
<li>Feed Your Strengths! Make sure you have opportunities to have new experiences to feel your 
quest of understanding the world. </li>
<li>Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some traits are strengths and some are 
weaknesses. By facing your weaknesses, you can overcome them and they will have less power 
over you. </li>
<li>Express Your Feelings. Don’t let anger get bottled up inside you. If you have strong feelings, sort 
them out and express them, or they may become destructive! </li>
<li>Make Decisions. Don't be afraid to have an opinion. You need to know how you feel about things 
in order to be effective.</li> 
<li>Smile at Criticism. Try to see disagreement and discord as an opportunity for growth, because 
that’s exactly what it is. Try not to become overly defensive towards criticism; try to hear it and 
judge it objectively. </li>
<li>Be Aware of Others. Remember that there are 15 other personality types out there who see things 
differently than you see them. Most of your problems with other people are easier to deal with if 
you try to understand the other person's perspective. </li>
<li>Be Aware of Yourself. Don't stint your own needs for the sake of others too much. Realize you 
are an important focus. If you do not fulfill your own needs, how will continue to be effective and 
how will others know you are true to your beliefs? </li>
<li>Be Accountable for Yourself. Don’t waste mental energy finding blame in other’s behavior, or in 
identifying yourself as a victim. You have more control over your life than any other person has.</li> 
<li>Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself by assuming the worst. Remember that a positive 
attitude creates positive situations. </li>
<li>When in Doubt, Ask Questions! Don't assume that the lack of feedback is the same thing as 
negative feedback. If you need feedback and don't have any, ask for it.</li>
