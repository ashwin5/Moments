   The Giver 
   </center></h3>
   <p>
   As a giver your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how you fit into your personal value system. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. 
</p>

<p>
You are more people-focused individuals. You live in the world of people possibilities. More so than any other type, you have excellent people skills. You understand and care about people, and have a special talent for bringing out the best in others. Your main interest in life is to give love, support, and a good time to other people. You are focused on understanding, supporting, and encouraging others. You make things happen for people, and get your best personal satisfaction from this. 
</p>

<p>
Because Your people skills are so extraordinary, you have the ability to make people do exactly what you want them to do. You get under people's skins and get the reactions that you are seeking. Your motives are usually unselfish, but You who have developed less than ideally have been known to use your power over people to manipulate them.
</p>

<p>
You are so externally focused that it's especially important for you to spend time alone. This can be difficult for you or some of your kind, because you have the tendency to be hard on yourselves and turn to dark thoughts when alone. Consequently, you might avoid being alone, and fill your lives with activities involving other people. You tends to define your life's direction and priorities according to other people's needs, and may not be aware of your own needs. It's natural to your personality type that you will tend to place other people's needs above your own, but you need to stay aware of your own needs so that you don't sacrifice yourselves in your drive to help others.
</p>

<p> 
You tend to be more reserved about exposing yourselves than other extraverted types. Although you may have strongly-felt beliefs, you're likely to refrain from expressing them if doing so would interfere with bringing out the best in others. Because your strongest interest lies in being a catalyst of change in other people, you're likely to interact with others on your own level, in a chameleon-like manner, rather than as individuals. 
</p>

<p>
You have definite values and opinions which you're able to express clearly and succinctly. These beliefs will be expressed as long as you're not too personal. You is in many ways expressive and open, but is more focused on being responsive and supportive of others. When faced with a conflict between a strongly-held value and serving another person's need, you are highly likely to value the other person's needs. You may feel quite lonely even when surrounded by people. This feeling of aloneness may be exacerbated by the tendency to not reveal your true selves. 
</p>

<p>
People love You. You are fun to be with, and truly understand and love people. You are typically very straight-forward and honest. Usually You exudes a lot of self-confidence, and have a great amount of ability to do many different things. You are generally bright, full of potential, energetic and fast-paced. You are usually good at anything which captures your interest.
</p>

<p> 
You like for things to be well-organized, and will work hard at maintaining structure and resolving ambiguity. You have a tendency to be fussy, especially with your home environments.
</p>

<p> 
In the work place, You do well in positions where you deal with people. You are natural for the social committee. Your uncanny ability to understand people and say just what needs to be said makes everyone happy, makes you natural for counseling. You enjoy being the center of attention, and do very well in situations where you can inspire and lead others, such as teaching.You do not like dealing with impersonal reasoning. you don't understand or appreciate its merit, and will be unhappy in situations where you're forced to deal with logic and facts without any connection to a human element. Living in the 	world of people possibilities, you enjoy your plans more than your achievements. You get excited about possibilities for the future, but may become easily bored and restless with the present.
</p>

<p>
You have a special gift with people, and are basically happy people when you can use that gift to help others. You get your best satisfaction from serving others. Your genuine interest in Humankind and your exceptional intuitive awareness of people makes them able to draw out even the most reserved individuals. You have a strong need for close, intimate relationships, and will put forth a lot of effort in creating and 
maintaining these relationships. You're very loyal and trustworthy once involved in a relationship. 
</p>

<p>
You who has not developed your Feeling side may have difficulty making good decisions, and may rely heavily on other people in decision-making processes. If you have not developed your Intuition, you may not be able to see possibilities, and will judge things too quickly based on established value systems or social rules, without really understanding the current situation.You who has not found your place in 
the world is likely to be extremely sensitive to criticism, and to have the tendency to worry excessively and feel guilty. you are also likely to be very manipulative and controlling with others.
</p>
<p> 
In general, You are charming, warm, gracious, creative and diverse individuals with richly developed insights into what makes other people tick. This special ability to see growth potential in others combined with a genuine drive to help people makes you a truly valued individual. As giving and caring as the You is, you need to remember to value your own needs as well as the needs of others.

You thrive when able to “make things right” for others, to enable and empower your co-workers, friends and family through valuing your human strengths and abilities. When gifted with the added Your ability to intuitively adapt your feelings to the way you are affected by others, the You has a positive drive to find co-operative pathways leading to the best possible outcome for all. Success for an You comes through involvement in the process of making things happen for people; through the accomplishments and satisfactions of those you have helped to enrich the human world with greater value, and through finding that your efforts on behalf of others have fulfilled your own life as well.</p>

<u>Allowing Your You Strengths to Flourish</u> 

<p>As an You, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging your growth and development, you will more readily see your place in the world, and be more content with your role. </p>

</ul>

<u>Potential Problem Areas </u>

<p>With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be no "good". Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas.</p> 

<p>Most of the weaker characteristics found in You are due to your dominant Extraverted Feeling overvaluing what you see as objective values in the external world and thereby judging too much by the needs of others, or by appearances. This is primarily due to you having not fully adapted your Introverted Intuitive function sufficiently for them to be able to discern the vast range of ways in which you might be being missing the underlying needs within yourselves and being misled by such appearances. You naturally looks outward to find value and satisfaction, and whilst it is essential that this direction be taken to fulfil your primary needs of relation and comfort, without the supportive balance of a well developed Intuitive function, You can overvalue the external world to the point where you lose sight of yourself, becoming fixed in your judgements about people and the world. In such cases, You will tend to live in a rigid - and to others, somewhat surreal - world of definite values which often seems “overstated” or obsessively connected to other people or human situations.</p> 

<u>Explanation of Problems </u>

<p>Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to your problem of wanting to find the “proper” value in everything. If the you does not learn how to see beneath the appearance of what you quickly judge as good or bad about the people and situations in your external environment, you will only use your introverted intuition to support those judgements your feel are good for them and disregard not only other possibilities but your own quality of inner life as well. The consideration of these less obvious possibilities and your own needs requires that you recognize that your own value judgements are indeed subjective, and that it is not appropriate or effective to apply them across the board to all civilized people. The practice of standing back and looking 
objectively at your own value system which is not something that you are accustomed to doing; trying to 
avoid abstract rationalization of problems and the feelings in you engender is a natural survival technique for 
Your personality. The main driver to Your personality is Extraverted Feeling, whose purpose is 
above all to find and discriminate the values in people and human situations. If your ability to find a 
specific and worthy value in a person or situation is threatened,  you shuts out the threatening force. 
This is totally natural, but unfortunately the individual who exercises this type of agenda protection 
regularly and become more and more rigid in  judgements and expectations of people, but even less 
concerned with the effect such conditions have upon yourselves. Where the unbalanced you does 
acquiesce to the images of intuition, these will generally be skewed to support the subjective agenda of 
dominant Feeling. In this way you always find justification for your determinations and your self 
sacrifices to people, things and situations, and you will be unable locate the reality of another’s true feelings, nor be interested in discovering that your seemingly objective judgments miss the reasons and subjectivities underlying both your own and others lives or worldly situation.</p> 

<p>Petulance, pensiveness and a sense of being let down by others can often be the end result of this one sided 
approach to the world, whilst if you are in a strong company or relationship position you might 
become driven to manipulate others and situations to conform it to your own feeling needs and value 
judgements, irrespective of any true value to the situation or for the other persons involved. In this case, the 
“big picture” valued for its great worth to all, becomes a dominant drive which seeks to blot out or crush 
any opposition by claiming the moral high ground, even to the point where the You sacrifices your own 
life to the “cause”. The inability to recognize the plethora of subjective possibilities your feelings bring into 
your lives and strip the unbalanced you of your access to both a deeper connection with others and the 
possibility of refining and developing pathways to the kind of self understanding and self nurturing your 
finer judgements might otherwise lead them to.</p> 

<u>Solutions</u> 

<p>To grow as an individual, You need to focus on paying attention to your inner images. This means you need to be open to the possibilities that lie beneath your judgments and values, rather than just accepting the appearance of values which accord with your sense of rightness. You need to understand that developing your ability to see the subjective possibilities within yourselves and others does not threaten your ability to make correct judgments, but rather enhances it, and enhances your personal chances for achieving a measure of success in your lives.</p> 

<p>You are concerned with your personal growth and will pay close attention to your motivation for accepting values that come to you. Are you trying to see the background of circumstance behind your own and others value judgments, or are you trying to maintain your own image of how things “ought” to be? The goal is to find a balance between what seems correct and valuable and the many possible ways in which such a judgment might be subjective and not necessarily the best for yourselves or a situation. Obviously, this is not entirely possible, but it is the exercise to keep in mind. you need to see the many divergent images of values and your conflicts which affect them, without feeling threatened, and without losing your sense of what is right and wrong.</p> 

<u>Living Happily in our World</u>

<p>As can be seen from the above, some strongly expressed that your personality can have difficulty fitting into society. 
your problems are usually due to your Extraverted Feeling being so dominant that you are so strongly bound to what you see as objective values that you cannot relate to the world except via the objects of your feeling. In such cases the intensity of your judgments can actually drive others away from 
them, and the resulting lack of close relationship felt as a personal failing for which You feel guilty. Such guilt can drive even more strongly affective behavior which leads You to ignore your own needs entirely, or it can become a negative drive to manipulate others to conform to your one-sided vision of the world. You who consistently tries to see the underlying possibilities and the scope available in each situation will be able to see the right path to take with each person and situation in your life. This will always lead you toward closer relationships, happiness and great achievements.</p> 

<p>The key to personal growth for You is competent execution of Intuition. Because it is often hard to define what this represents subjectively to each person, here are some action-oriented suggestions that will help lead you down the path towards more effective use of the Introverted Intuitive function. </p>

<u>Specific suggestions only for you : </u> 

<p>When confronted by a person or a situation which seems to be rejecting or rebuffing your value judgements and your mind filling with all the arguments, images and alternatives to the situation, look closely at those you are immediately rejecting as negative or unsuitable ways to proceed. Within these images often lie paths to understanding and agreement if you look more closely. Some of these images hold the key to seeing another’s feelings and point of view more clearly. Remember, what seems positive to you may not be everything or even important to another.Behind everything of value that you see lies much potential. Try not to be satisfied with just a good result, but let yourself imagine the ways in which a person might fulfil all your creative aspects; the ways in which a situation might become useful to many more than just what it was made for. Try to imagine everything as a source of untapped magic and creative power – let your mind see all the things it might become. Above all, apply this exercise to yourself, as if you were seeing yourself in a mirror: just as you would another person whom you love.</p> 

<p>When you are alone try to become fully aware of how it feels to you, try to recognize the emptiness as a place of potential, try to imagine what you might be able to do for others in this empty time, try to realize that you are not truly alone but with this special person who is yourself. What would you do for this person if you could make your private world a better place?</p> 

<p> Allow yourself to feel the meanings and purposes of the world, let them become a valuable gift which can be expressed in your dealings with others and in the things you strive for.</p> 

Ten Rules to Live By to Achieve Success
<ol>  
<li>Feed Your Strengths! Make sure you have opportunities to involve yourself with others in situations where your input is valued.</li> 
<li>Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some traits are strengths and some are weaknesses. By facing your weaknesses, you can overcome them and you will have less power over you. </li>
<li>Express Your Feelings. Understand that your feelings are as important as others are in the overall situation. Without your feelings and needs being valued the best result is not realized, so value and speak to your own feelings as much as you value those of others.</li> 
<li>Make Decisions. Don't be afraid to have an opinion. You need to know show others the qualities and potentials you can see are worthy of action.</li> 
<li>Smile at Criticism. Try to see why disagreement and discord indicate the differences between people, and use this as an opportunity to make your value judgments useful for growth, because that's exactly what you are. Try not to feel responsible for another’s criticism, but try to hear it and understand the feelings and images it engenders within you. Then you may see a path not only to agreement but to a shared and truly valuable end.</li> 
<li>Be Aware of Others. Remember that there are 15 other personality types out there who see things differently than you see them. Most of your problems with other people are easier to deal with if you try to understand the other person's perspective.</li> 
<li> Be Aware of Yourself. Don't stint your own needs for the sake of others too much. Realize you are an important focus. If you do not fulfil your own needs, how will continue to be effective and how will others know you are true to your beliefs?</li> 
<li>Be Gentle in Your Expectations. It is easy for you to see the value in others, but stressing this too much can drive them away. Try to show that you understand your fears and limitations and lead them gently to see how you feel: lead them gently into understanding and love.</li> 
<li> Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself by feeling that your values are lost upon others – you are not. Perhaps it just has to sit with them too. Let the situation resolve itself and never stop believing that love is the true answer.</li> 
<li> When in Doubt, Ask Questions! Don't assume that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback. If you need feedback and don't have any, ask for it.</li>
</ol>
