will also have difficulty expressing their ideas, which are non-linear. However, their 
extreme respect of knowledge and intelligence will motivate them to explain themselves 
to another person who they feel is deserving of the effort.</p> 
<p>INTJ’s are natural leaders, although they usually choose to remain in the background 
until they see a real need to take over the lead. When they are in leadership roles, they are 
quite effective, because they are able to objectively see the reality of a situation, and are 
adaptable enough to change things which aren't working well. They are the supreme 
strategists - always scanning available ideas and concepts and weighing them against 
their current strategy, to plan for every conceivable contingency.INTJ’s spend a lot of time inside their own minds, and may have little interest in the other 
people's thoughts or feelings. Unless their Feeling side is developed, they may have 
problems giving other people the level of intimacy that is needed. Unless their Sensing 
side is developed, they may have a tendency to ignore details which are necessary for 
implementing their ideas.</p> 
<p>The INTJ's interest in dealing with the world is to make decisions, express judgments, 
and put everything that they encounter into an understandable and rational system. 
Consequently, they are quick to express judgments. Often they have very evolved 
intuitions, and are convinced that they are right about things. Unless they complement 
their intuitive understanding with a well-developed ability to express their insights, they 
may find themselves frequently misunderstood. In these cases, INTJ’s tend to blame 
misunderstandings on the limitations of the other party, rather than on their own difficulty 
in expressing themselves. This tendency may cause the INTJ to dismiss others input too 
quickly, and to become generally arrogant and elitist. </p>
<p>INTJ’s are ambitious, self-confident, deliberate, long-range thinkers. Many INTJ’s end 
up in engineering or scientific pursuits, although some find enough challenge within the 
business world in areas which involve organizing and strategic planning. They dislike 
messiness and inefficiency, and anything that is muddled or unclear. They value clarity 
and efficiency, and will put enormous amounts of energy and time into consolidating 
their insights into structured patterns.</p> 
<p>Other people may have a difficult time understanding an INTJ. They may see them as 
aloof and reserved. Indeed, the INTJ is not overly demonstrative of their affections, and 
is likely to not give as much praise or positive support as others may need or desire. That 
doesn't mean that he or she doesn't truly have affection or regard for others, they simply 
do not typically feel the need to express it. Others may falsely perceive the INTJ as being 
rigid and set in their ways. Nothing could be further from the truth, because the INTJ is 
committed to always finding the objective best strategy to implement their ideas. The 
INTJ is usually quite open to hearing an alternative way of doing something. </p>
<p>When under a great deal of stress, the INTJ may become obsessed with mindless 
repetitive, sensate activities, such as over-drinking. They may also tend to become 
absorbed with minutia and details that they would not normally consider important to 
their overall goal.</p> 
<p>INTJ’s need to remember to express themselves sufficiently, so as to avoid difficulties 
with people misunderstandings. In the absence of properly developing their 
communication abilities, they may become abrupt and short with people, and 
isolationists.</p> 
<p>INTJ’s have a tremendous amount of ability to accomplish great things. They have 
insight into the Big Picture, and are driven to synthesize their concepts into solid plans of 
action. Their reasoning skills give them the means to accomplish that. INTJ’s are most 
always highly competent people, and will not have a problem meeting their career oreducation goals. They have the capability to make great strides in these arenas. On a 
personal level, the INTJ who practices tolerances and puts effort into effectively 
communicating their insights to others has everything in his or her power to lead a rich 
and rewarding life.</p>

<p>More so than any other personality type, INTJ’s are brilliant when it comes to grasping 
complex theories and applying them to problems to come up with long-term strategies. 
Since this type of "strategizing" is the central focus and drive of the INTJ, there is a 
happy match between desire and ability in this type. Accordingly, the INTJ is happiest 
and most effective in careers which allow this type of processing, and which promote an 
environment in which the INTJ is given a lot of autonomy over their daily lives.</p>

seriously, but are open to redefining their vows, if they see something which may proveto be an improvement over the existing understanding. INTJ’s are not likely to be 
"touchy-feely" and overly affirming with their mates or children, and may at times be 
somewhat insensitive to their emotional needs. However, INTJ’s are in general extremely 
capable and intelligent individuals who strive to always be their best, and be moving in a 
positive direction. If they apply these basic goals to their personal relationships, they 
likely to enjoy happy and healthy interaction with their families and friends. </p>

       <p>People with the INTJ personality type are serious, analytical and often perfectionist. They 
look at a problem or idea from multiple perspectives and systematically analyze it with 
objective logic, discarding things that turn out to be problematic, and evolving their own 
understanding of something when new information turns out to be useful. There is no 
other personality type who does this as naturally as the INTJ. They are natural scientists 
and mathematicians. Once given an idea, they are driven to understand it as thoroughly as 
possible. They usually have very high standards for their own understanding and 
accomplishments, and generally will only value and consider other individuals who have 
shown that they meet or surpass the INTJ's own understanding on a given issue. INTJ’s 
value clarity and conciseness, and have little esteem for behaviors and attitudes that are 
purely social. Social "niceties" often seem unnecessary and perhaps even not genuine to 
the INTJ, who is always seeking to improve their substantive understanding. INTJ's 
highly value social interaction that is centered around the meaningful exchange of ideas, 
but they usually dismiss the importance of being friendly or likeable in other social 
contexts, and they are likely to be uncomfortable with interactions that are primarily 
emotional, rather than logical. INTJ’s value structure, order, knowledge, competence, and 
logic. Above all, they value their own ideas and intuitions about the world. An INTJ's 
feeling of success depends primarily upon their own level of understanding andaccomplishment, but also depends upon the level of structure in their life, and their ability 
to respect the intelligence and competence of those who share their life. </p>

       <p>As an INTJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural 
strengths for other types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth 
and development, you will more readily see your place in the world, and be more content 
with your role. </p>
<p>Nearly all INTJ’s will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should 
embrace and nourish these strengths: </p>
<p>The INTJ's mind is naturally geared towards systematically analyzing information from 
many contextual perspectives, and rejecting or retaining information as they become 
aware of its usefulness or validity. They probably do very well in school, and in any 
pursuit that requires serious analytical thinking. </p>
<p>They're extremely insightful, and see things that are not obvious to others. This ability to 
see patterns and meanings in the world can help the INTJ in many different ways. 
When given a goal or context, an INTJ is able to generate all kinds of possibilities. 
They're able to see the problem from many different angles, and come up with a solution 
that fits the needs of the current situation. </p>
<p>They don't take criticism personally, and are open to changing their opinions when 
they're shown a better idea or better way of doing something.</p> 
<p>An INTJ has a "stick to it" attitude. They're not afraid of hard work, and will put forth a 
great deal of effort towards something that they are interested in. This persistence will 
help the INTJ to achieve any identified goal. 
Usually intelligent and able to concentrate and focus, the INTJ can usually grasp difficult 
ideas and concepts. </p>
<p>INTJ’s who have a well-developed Extraverted Thinking function to complement their 
dominant Introverted iNtuition will enjoy these very special gifts: 
They can discriminate well amongst their intuitions and build ingenious systems to meet 
identified goals, or determine a successful plan of action to meet an identified need. In 
such a way, they may be brilliant scientists, doctors, mathematicians, or corporate 
strategists. </p>
<p>Their deep understanding, logical abilities, and persistence may enable them to make 
discoveries or uncover new ways of looking at something. In such a way, they may 
perform a great service to society. For example, an INTJ is the likely personality type to 
discover the cure for cancer.The INTJ with well-developed judgment will be able to grasp and process concepts that 
are beyond what their natural intelligence appears to be able to handle. 
If they have achieved a good amount of life wisdom, an INTJ can become a powerful 
political force. </p>

      <div class="panel-body">
     	<p>With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be 
no "good". Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we 
often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of 
life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, but also face our weaknesses and 
deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our personality type's potential problem 
areas.</p> 
<p>INTJ’s are rare and intelligent people with many special gifts. This should be kept in 
mind as you read some of the more negative material about INTJ weaknesses. Remember 
that these weaknesses are natural. We offer this information to enact positive change, 
rather than as blatant criticism. We want you to grow into your full potential, and be the 
happiest and most successful person that you can become. </p>
<p>Most of the weaker characteristics that are found in INTJ’s are due to their dominant 
function (Introverted iNtuition) overtaking their personality to the point that the other 
forces in their personality exist merely to serve the purposes of Introverted iNtuition. In 
such cases, an INTJ may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying 
degrees: </p>
<li>May be unaware (and sometimes uncaring) of how they come across to others</li> 
<li>May quickly dismiss input from others without really considering it </li> 
<li>May apply their judgment more often towards others, rather than towards 
themselves </li> 
<li>With their ability to see an issue from many sides, they may always find others at 
fault for problems in their own lives </li> 
<li>May look at external ideas and people with the primary purpose of finding fault </li> 
<li>May take pride in their ability to be critical and find fault in people and things </li> 
<li>May have unrealistic and/or unreasonable expectations of others </li> 
<li>May be intolerant of weaknesses in others </li> 
<li>May believe that they're always right </li> 
<li>May be cuttingly derisive and sarcastic towards others </li> 
<li>May have an intense and quick temper </li> 
<li>May hold grudges, and have difficulty forgiving people </li> 
<li>May be wishy-washy and unsure how to act in situations that require quick 
decision making </li> 
<li>May have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings to others</li>  
<li>May see so many tangents everywhere that they can't stay focused on the bottom 
line or the big pictureExplanation of Problems </li> 
</ul>
<p>Most of the problems described above are a result of Introverted iNtuition overtaking the 
INTJ's personality to the point that all of the other functions become slaves to Introverted 
iNtuition. A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and 
auxiliary functions. For an INTJ, the dominant Introverted iNtuition needs to be well- 
supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Thinking function. If Extraverted Thinking exists 
only to support the desires of Introverted iNtuition, then neither function is being used to 
its potential. </p>
<p>Introverted iNtuition is a personality function that constantly gathers information, and 
sees everything from many different perspectives. As the dominant player in a 
personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with new information 
to consider. Introverted iNtuition is sort of like a framework for understanding that exists 
in the mind. As something is perceived, it is melded into the existing intuitive framework. 
If an entirely new piece of information is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that 
person must redefine their entire framework of reference. So, Introverted iNtuitives are 
constantly taking in information about the world that needs to be processed in a relatively 
lengthy manner in order to be understood. That presents quite a challenge to the INTJ. It's 
not unusual for an INTJ to feel overwhelmed with all of the things that he or she needs to 
consider in order to fully understand an idea or situation.</p> 
<p>When Introverted iNtuition dominates the INTJ such that the other functions cannot serve 
their own purposes, we find the INTJ cutting off information that it needs to consider. If 
the psyche is presented with information that looks anything like something that 
Introverted iNtuition has processed in the past, it uses Extraverted Thinking to quickly 
reject that information. The psyche uses Extraverted Thinking to reject the ideas, rather 
than analyzing the information within its intuitive framework, and therefore reduces the 
likelihood that the framework will have to be reshaped and redefined. </p>
<p>Using Extraverted Thinking in this manner serves the INTJ's psyche in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>it saves it the energy that would have to be expended to truly consider new information, and </li>
<li>it protects the INTJ's sacred inner world. In either case, it is not ideal. It causes the 
INTJ to not consider information that may be useful or critical in developing a real 
understanding of an issue. It also probably causes the INTJ to come off as too strongly 
opinionated or snobbish to others.</li>
</ol> 
<p>The better use of Extraverted Thinking for an INTJ would be to use it to assess the INTJ's 
rich insights and weigh them against the external world. When the INTJ personality uses 
Extraverted Thinking to cut off incoming information, rather than to judge internal 
intuitions, it is effectively cheating itself. It's like getting the answers to a test without 
having to really understand the questions. It's easier to get the answer right away, rather 
than to have to figure everything out. For the INTJ, who has a tremendous amount of 
information and "studying" that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts. 
Most INTJ’s will do this to some extent. The real problems occur when an INTJ 
personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely self-important and 
rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas.</p>

        <p>To grow as an individual, the INTJ needs to focus on applying their judgment to things 
only after they have gone through their intuition. In other words, the INTJ needs to 
consciously try not to use their judgment to dismiss ideas prematurely. Rather, they 
should use their judgment against their own ideas. One cannot effectively judge 
something that they don't understand. The INTJ needs to take things entirely into their 
intuition in order to understand them. It may be necessary to give your intuition enough 
time to work through the new information so that it can rebuild its global framework of 
understanding. INTJ’s need to focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but 
rather to support their intuitive framework. </p>
<p>An INTJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of 
their judgments, and their motivation for making judgments. Are they judging something 
external to themselves, or are they judging something that they have sifted through their 
intuition? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand its usefulness 
in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an INTJ will judge something without properly 
understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to 
judge. </p>

associated with not knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, with having 
unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors, and with not putting forth effort to meet 
others' emotional needs. These issues stem primarily from the common INTJ habit of 
using Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally, rather than internally, and therefore 
diminish the importance of the external world, and increase the importance of the INTJ's 
own internal world. INTJ’s who recognize that their knowledge and understanding (and 
therefore general happiness and feeling of success) can be enriched by the synergy of 
other people's knowledge and understanding will find that they can be committed to their 
rich internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with others. In order to 
accomplish this, the INTJ needs to recognize the importance of extraversion, and develop 
their highest extraverted function, Extraverted Thinking.</p> 
<p>An INTJ who uses Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally rather than internally 
may become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations 
for others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others 
may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others. 
This will preserve the sanctity of the INTJ's inner world of ideas, but will reduce a lot of 
valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the 
development of the INTJ's rich structural framework of understanding. In extreme cases, 
the INTJ may find himself or herself quite along and lonely. </p>
<p>More commonly, an INTJ's interpersonal problems will occur when they express their 
displeasure to those close to them in very biting and hurtful terms. Everyone needs 
emotional distance at one time or another and the INTJ wants more than most types.Perhaps this is why INTJ’s are famous for their biting sarcasm. An INTJ's internal world 
is extremely important to them. They may be protecting their internal world by using 
sarcasm to keep others at an emotional distance, or they may be sarcastic with others 
because they believe that they have the more evolved and logical understanding of the 
issue at hand, and seek to cut off the spurious input that they're receiving. This is an 
important distinction to recognize. An INTJ who is seeking an emotional respite can find 
ways to be alone that don't require injuring feelings and damaging relationships. When 
distance is required, the INTJ should just "leave". If an explanation is necessary, an INTJ 
should use their Extraverted Thinking to explain their need rationally and objectively, 
rather than using Extraverted Thinking to insult the other person, and therefore prod them 
into leaving. </p>

     	<p>Take care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask 
questions if necessary. Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea. 
Try not to begin judging anything about the idea until you have understood it entirely. 
Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person. 
Take in that person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with 
whom you're speaking.</p> 
<p>If you become upset, walk away immediately. DO NOT express anger. When you get 
angry, you lose. After you have calmed down, apologize for leaving and continue with 
what you were doing.</p> 
<p>Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life. 
Remember that people with the Sensing preference need to be communicated with in a 
direct, concise manner. Speak plainly and simply with Sensors, giving "yes" or "no" 
answers.</p> 
<p>Try to be on good terms with all people, even those that you consider beneath you. Try to 
understand that everybody has something to offer.</p> 
<p>When you make judgments or decisions, try to be aware of your motivation for making 
the judgment. Are you more interested in finding fault externally, or in improving your 
own understanding? Seek first to understand, and then to judge.</p>

     <ol>
<li> Feed Your Strengths! Do things that allow your brilliant intuition and logical 
abilities to flourish. Explore the fascinating worlds of science, mathematics, law 
and medicine. Give your mind an outlet for its exceptional analytical abilities, and 
watch them grow.</li>  
<li>Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to 
overcome them. Especially, strive to use your judgment against your internal 
ideas and intuitions, rather than as a means of disregarding other people's ideas.</li> 
<li>Talk Through Your Thoughts. You need to step through your intuitions in order to 
put them into perspective. Give yourself time to do this, and take advantage of 
discussing ideas with others. You'll find externalizing your internal intuitions to 
be a valuable exercise. If you don't have someone to discuss your ideas with, try 
expressing your ideas clearly in writing.</li>  
<li>Take in Everything. Don't dismiss ideas prematurely because you don't respect the 
person generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After 
all, everybody has something to offer, and nobody knows everything. Steven 
Covey says it so well when he says: "Seek first to understand, and then to be 
understood." </li> 
<li>When You Get Angry, You Lose. Your passion and intensity are strong assets, 
but can be very harmful if you allow yourself to fall into the "Anger Trap". 
Remember that Anger is destructive to your personal relationships. Work through 
your anger before you impress it upon others, or you will likely find yourself 
alone. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled effectively in a 
non-personal and dispassionate manner. </li> 
<li>Respect your Need for Intellectual Compatibility Don't expect yourself to be a 
"touchy-feely" or "warm-fuzzy" person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with 
others will start with the head, rather than the heart. Be aware of other's emotional 
needs, and express your genuine love and respect for them in terms that are real to 
YOU. Be yourself. </li> 
<li>Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other 
people. Look inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than 
you have. </li> 
<li>Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.</li>  
<li>Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side 
of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is 
a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by 
positive attitudes. Expect the best, and the best will come forward. </li> 
<li>Don't Get Isolated! Recognize the value that the external world represents to you, 
and interact with it in the style that's natural to you. Join clubs and internet e-mail 
lists that house in-depth discussions of topics that you're interested in. Seek and 
foster friendships with others of like competence and capacity for understanding. 
Extravert in your own style. </li>
