      	<p>As an ISTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with 
things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things 
in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.</p> 
<p>ISTP's have a compelling drive to understand the way things work. They're good at 
logical analysis, and like to use it on practical concerns. They typically have strong 
powers of reasoning, although they're not interested in theories or concepts unless they 
can see a practical application. They like to take things apart and see the way they work. 
ISTP’s have an adventuresome spirit. They are attracted to motorcycles, airplanes, sky 
diving, surfing, etc. They thrive on action, and are usually fearless. ISTP’s are fiercely 
independent, needing to have the space to make their own decisions about their next step. 
They do not believe in or follow rules and regulations, as this would prohibit their ability 
to "do their own thing". Their sense of adventure and desire for constant action makes 
ISTP’s prone to becoming bored rather quickly.</p> 
<p>ISTP’s are loyal to their causes and beliefs, and are firm believers that people should be 
treated with equity and fairness. Although they do not respect the rules of the "System", 
they follow their own rules and guidelines for behavior faithfully. They will not take part 
in something which violates their personal laws. ISTP’s are extremely loyal and faithful 
to their "brothers". </p>
<p>ISTP’s like and need to spend time alone, because this is when they can sort things out in 
their minds most clearly. They absorb large quantities of impersonal facts from the 
external world, and sort through those facts, making judgments, when they are alone. 
ISTP’s are action-oriented people. They like to be up and about, doing things. They are 
not people to sit behind a desk all day and do long-range planning. Adaptable and 
spontaneous, they respond to what is immediately before them. They usually have strong 
technical skills, and can be effective technical leaders. They focus on details and practical 
things. They have an excellent sense of expediency and grasp of the details which enables 
them to make quick, effective decisions.</p> 
<p>ISTP’s avoid making judgments based on personal values - they feel that judgments and 
decisions should be made impartially, based on the fact. They are not naturally tuned in 
to how they are affecting others. They do not pay attention to their own feelings, and 
even distrust them and try to ignore them, because they have difficulty distinguishingbetween emotional reactions and value judgments. This may be a problem area for many 
ISTP’s.</p> 
<p>An ISTP who is over-stressed may exhibit rash emotional outbursts of anger, or on the 
other extreme may be overwhelmed by emotions and feelings which they feel compelled 
to share with people (often inappropriately). An ISTP who is down on themselves will 
foray into the world of value judgments - a place which is not natural for the ISTP - and 
judge themselves by their inability to perform some task. They will then approach the 
task in a grim emotional state, expecting the worst. </p>
<p>ISTP’s are excellent in a crisis situations. They're usually good athletes, and have very 
good hand-eye coordination. They are good at following through with a project, and tying 
up loose ends. They usually don't have much trouble with school, because they are 
introverts who can think logically. They are usually patient individuals, although they 
may be prone to occasional emotional outbursts due to their inattention to their own 
feelings.</p> 
<p>ISTP’s have a lot of natural ability which makes them good at many different kinds of 
things. However, they are happiest when they are centered in action-oriented tasks which 
require detailed logical analysis and technical skill. They take pride in their ability to take 
the next correct step.</p> 
<p>ISTP’s are optimistic, full of good cheer, loyal to their equals, uncomplicated in their 
desires, generous, trusting and receptive people who want no part in confining 
commitments.</p>

<p>The ISTP is fortunate because they have the abilities to be good at many different kinds 
of tasks. Their introverted and thinking preferences give them the ability to concentrate 
and work through problems which leaves many doors open to them. However, to be 
happiest, the ISTP needs to lead a lifestyle which offers a great deal of autonomy and 
does not include much external enforcement of structure. ISTP’s will do best working for 
themselves, or working in very flexible environments. Their natural interests lie towards 
applying their excellent reasoning skills against known facts and data to discover 
underlying structure, or solutions to practical questions.</p>

       <p>ISTP’s are generally extremely capable individuals who are good at most things which 
interest them. They are usually bright, interesting, and exciting individuals with a lot to 
offer. They live almost entirely in the present moment, and usually do not make 
commitments beyond the immediate foreseeable future. An ISTP probably coined the 
phrase "nothing is unconditional". They strongly prefer to take things one day at a time, 
rather than make long-term commitments. If a relationship interests them and satisfies 
their needs, the ISTP will do their part on a daily basis to keep the relationship strong and 
healthy. If they lose interest in a relationship, their natural tendency will be to move on.</p>

    <div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
       <p>People with the ISTP personality type are action-oriented thinkers. They are highly tuned 
into their immediate environment, and driven to interact with it in a hands-on fashion. It 
is by working with things in their environment that they experience and understand life. 
By working physically with their environment, they have a natural and immediate 
understanding of how things work, and how best to achieve their identified goals.</p> 
<p>Although they constantly use logic to determine how to best manipulate objects in their 
immediate situation, they are not naturally analytical in a more objective sense. When 
they step back to methodically analyze the relationship between objects in their world, 
they often lose touch with their understanding. Their understanding is intimately tied into 
their physical experience with reality. It is immediate and holistic. They are naturally "in- 
sync" with the physical world, and value life largely in terms of their ability to flow with 
and conquer the physical challenges presented to them. Although they think about and 
value past experiences, they live almost entirely in the here and now. ISTP’s are natural 
mechanics, athletes, musicians, technicians, and engineers. They excel at tasks that 
require a great deal of tactile mastery, as well as quick, logic-based action. ISTP’s are 
most comfortable using their known skills, rather than being thrown into situations with 
which they have no personal experience. The nuances of variation in each individual 
situation will bring a sense of newness and freshness to the experience for the ISTP.</p> 
<p>ISTP’s often resist and rebel situations that are entirely new, or that require a great deal 
of structured planning and thinking. This way of thinking is foreign to the ISTP, and 
therefore uncomfortable. When someone tries to push or control the ISTP into these 
situations, he or she is likely to "walk away" from that person without looking back. 
Their resistance to structure may cause them to quit school early, quit jobs that they find 
stifling, or quit relationships that have too many expectations. ISTP’s are often likeable 
and have more friends and social interaction than is normal for an Introvert. The ISTP 
genuinely enjoys the company of their friends, and needs their input in his or her physical 
world to maintain their understanding of their own place in the world. An ISTP's feeling 
of success is dependent primarily upon their mastery of their physical world, but is also 
dependent upon the existence of strong, reliable, interpersonal relationships. Without 
these relationships, the ISTP is likely to avoid relationships, isolate him or herself, and 
feel very vulnerable to rejection and hurt.</p>

       <p>As an ISTP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural 
strengths for other types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth 
and development, you will more readily see your place in the world, and be more content 
with your role.</p>
<p>Nearly all ISTP’s will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should 
embrace and nourish these strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have a natural ability to focus and "become one" with their immediate 
environment. This ability allows them to be great athletes, dancers, and 
musicians. They have an innately graceful connection with the physical world.</li> 
<li>They are highly in tune with their physical surroundings, and therefore have well- 
developed aesthetic appreciation. They appreciate beauty. If they are so inclined,
they may develop their ability to control the physical world into some form of art 
expression, and become artists.</li> 
<li>They are exceptional troubleshooters in emergency situations. They can quickly 
take in the current situation and apply logic immediately to take steps that control 
the problem. Since the ISTP's use of logic is based on their personal experience, 
their ability to troubleshoot will get better and better as they gain more 
experience. For this reason, ISTP’s who are mechanics, technicians, and computer 
analysts (for example) often achieve "guru" status after they have been working in 
the field for a long time. </li>
<li>They're very sensual and earthy people. They usually a good deal of sex appeal 
and attractive sensuality.</li> 
</ul>
<p>ISTP’s who have developed their Extraverted Sensing to the extent that they regularly 
take in information in an objective fashion, rather than strictly to support their own way 
of life, will enjoy these very special gifts: </p>
<ul>
<li>They have attractive and compelling personalities, and are well-liked and 
accepted by most people. </li>
<li>They're usually quite intelligent, and can work through difficult problems.</li>
<li>They understand the benefits of close relationships, and understand how to 
support and enhance these relationships. </li>
<li>They can handle just about any task that they are presented with. </li>

     	<p>With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be 
no "good". Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we 
often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of 
life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, but also face our weaknesses and 
deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our personality type's potential problem 
areas.</p> 
<p>Most of the weaker characteristics that are found in ISTP’s are due to their dominant 
function of Introverted Thinking overtaking the personality to the point that all of the 
other functions exist merely to serve the purposes of Introverted Thinking. In such cases, 
an ISTP may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees:</p>
<ul> 
<li>The ISTP gets "stuck in a rut" and only does those things that are known and 
comfortable to the ISTP. 
<li>The ISTP resists and rejects anything that doesn't support their own experiential 
understanding of the world. If there is a conflict between their own way of life 
and something that they encounter, they don't perceive that "something" in an 
objective sense. Rather, they reject it to avoid conflict and to preserve the sanctity 
of their inner world. </li>
<li>They choose to surround themselves with people who support their own way of 
life, and reject people who think or live differently. </li>
<li>They may become overly paranoid about social organizations and institutions 
trying to control them. </li>
<li>They may unknowingly or uncaringly hurt people's feelings.</li> 
<li>They may be completely unaware of how to express their inner world to others in 
a meaningful way. </li>
<li>They may be completely unaware of the type of communication that is often 
desirable and (to some degree) expected in an intimate relationship. If they are 
aware of the kinds of things that are appropriate to say and do to foster emotional 
bonding, they may be unable to appreciate the value of such actions. They may 
feel too vulnerable to express themselves in this fashion, and so reject the entire 
idea. </li>
<li>If pushed beyond their comfort level to form commitments or emotional bonds, 
they may reject a relationship entirely. </li>
<li>Under stress, they may show intense emotions that seem disproportionate to the 
situation. </li>

    <div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various 
degrees to the common ISTP problem of only taking in information that relates to or 
supports their own life experience. The ISTP is driven to work with and understand his or 
her world by applying their special brand of logic (an immediate, spatial, "fuzzy" logic) 
to their physical experience. They don't necessarily have a goal in mind to achieve from 
this process - it is the process itself that is rewarding to the ISTP. In their zeal for the 
satisfaction that comes from mastering their physical environment in such a way, ISTP’s 
often selectively choose to put themselves in situations in which they have the 
opportunity to exercise these skills. That's certainly not a problem. Most personality types 
choose to do the things that they're best at most often. Such is the nature of capitalizing 
upon our strengths. The problem rears its ugly head when the goal of the ISTP becomes 
to achieve their personal satisfaction at all costs.</p> 
<p>It is healthy to choose your paths and goals in life so that they coincide with what you 
find rewarding, and what you're really good at. However, it sometimes happens that we 
take this approach a bit too far and sacrifice an accurate and objective understanding of 
the world for a more narrow vision that is easier and comfortable for us to deal with. The 
ISTP affects this problem when they stop taking in information in a truly objective sense, 
and instead only take in information that supports their way of life. </p>
<p>The dominant function of the ISTP is Introverted Thinking. This function is supported 
closely and importantly by the auxiliary function of Extraverted Sensing. Extraverted 
Sensing perceives the world and sends information into the psyche, where it is processed 
by Introverted Thinking. An ISTP who uses their Extraverted Sensing function in a 
diminished way is one who chooses to restrict their environment to people and places that 
support their favored activities. In such a way, the ISTP prevents his or her psyche from 
having to consider data from differing viewpoints and lifestyles, and thus promotes a 
lifestyle that allows them to frequently exercise and enhance their known tactile skills. It 
serves their immediate needs, which are the primary focus of the ISTP. However, it also 
promotes a lifestyle that is essentially self-centered and narrow in focus. It solves short- 
term problems, and creates long-term ones.</p>
<p>The ISTP's inferior (fourth) function is Extraverted Feeling. This means that the ISTP is 
not naturally in tune with how other people are feeling, or with social expectations. In 
fact, the ISTP is likely to reject the importance of social rituals, rules, and expectations. 
This is a natural weak point for the ISTP, which no doubt causes strife to the ISTP and 
their love partner. This weakness can be overcome by developing their Extraverted 
Sensing to the point that they can perceive Feeling type expectations in the external 
world. They don't have to use Extraverted Feeling to understand how to act in situations. 
They can perceive the expected behavior from their Extraverted Sensing function. 
However, if they are restricting their incoming data to only those things that support their 
existing way of life, then they are not learning from Extraverted Sensing at all. They are 
not growing their understanding of social and intimate behaviors - rather, they are 
reducing the importance of this type of understanding to their own life. In these 
situations, ISTP’s shy away from very close personal relationships, and feel more 
vulnerable and less sure of themselves in situations that involve expressing their 
emotions. </p>

      <p>To grow as an individual, the ISTP needs to focus on taking in as much information as 
possible through Extraverted Sensing. He or she needs to allow themselves to get into 
situations that they aren't necessarily comfortable with, or that are different from the 
situations that they would normally choose in life. The ISTP learns from experience, so 
the best way for the ISTP to grow as a person is to open him or herself to new 
experiences. Be aware of the tendency to want to run out and do something "new" that is 
actually just a different opportunity to exercise a known skill. Your task, as a person 
interested in personal growth, is to understand the world in a truly objective fashion, 
rather than understanding how the world fits in with your way of life. </p>

related to platonic friendships. Usually, the ISTP has trouble finding and maintaining a 
love relationship. The ISTP usually has very simple needs and expectations from their 
mates, and they're surprised and confused to find that their mates have more complex 
demands. They feel inadequate to meeting their mate's needs, and begin to get very 
uncomfortable with the situation as they perceive that they are expected to do something 
that it unknown to them. They back away from the relationship. Outside of a relationship, 
they feel more unloved and unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship

<li>Feed Your Strengths! Realize your gift at mastering your physical environment, 
and give yourself plenty of opportunities to exercise your abilities. Ride, play, 
paint, work it. Much of your sense of well-being will come from these 
experiences. </li> 
<li>Face Your Weaknesses! Face your fear of the unknown, and get yourself into new 
situations. Experience new activities and people with new perspectives. Don't 
isolate yourself into a narrow and lonely existence.</li>  
<li>Talk About Your Thoughts. Discussing your ideas and perceptions with others 
will help you to develop your Extraverted Sensing, and thus your understanding 
of the world. How well you use your auxiliary function is very important to your 
overall health and happiness. </li> 
<li>Don't Be Afraid to Love. That's just your old inferior function trying to convince 
you that you're unloved and unlovable. It's not true. Just because you're not sure 
what to do with yourself doesn't mean that you can't learn! Go on... jump in. The 
water's warm. </li> 
<li>Respect Your Need for Action. Understand that you need to be actively working 
with your environment to be "in the groove" with life. Don't chastise yourself for 
not being the sort to sit around and read a book or watch a movie. Choose a 
partner and companions who value active lifestyles. </li> 
<li>Recognize Social Principles. Realize that our society functions around some basic 
social principles, and that our society would fail unless those principles are 
recognized and upheld. In a democracy, people vote. At a red stoplight, people 
stop. If people stopped voting because it wasn't important to their own way of life, 
who would be in power? If people stopped stopping at red stop lights because it 
didn't fit into their way of life, how could we drive safely? Your priorities and 
beliefs are important, but you must recognize that the external world's agenda is 
also important. Don't dismiss the importance of principles that don't affect your 
life directly. </li> 
<li>It's OK to Get Out of your Comfort Zone. Understand that the only way to grow is 
to get outside of your comfort zone. If you're uncomfortable with an idea or 
situation because you're not sure how to act, that's good! That's an opportunity for 
growth. </li> 
<li>Identify and Express Your Feelings. You may have a hard time figuring out 
exactly how you feel about someone that you're involved with. It's important that 
you do figure this out. Don't lead someone on with your ambivalence. If you 
determine that you value the person, tell them so every time you think of it. Thisis the best way to make them feel secure in your affections, and so to promote a 
long-lasting relationship. </li> 
<li>Be Aware of Others. Try to really identify where people are coming from. Their 
ideas, thoughts and priorities are different from yours. They have something to 
offer you. Try to identify their personality types. </li> 
<li>Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself with fear and dark imaginings. Expect 
the best, and the best will come.</li>
